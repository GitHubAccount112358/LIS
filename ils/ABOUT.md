	- Because English is more rigorous and complete in some fields, I mainly use English to write LIS. But since my mother tongue and living environment are not English, there may be some English grammar problems. I'm sorry about that.And for specific cultural content, I will try to use the corresponding language
	- And I also know that there are many Cons in LIS, and I can’t maintain and upgrade continuously by myself. So I hope that other people’s use can make LIS more perfect and more effective
