# Definition
- a [[TransportProtocols]] to find documents when given their [[UniformResourceLocator]]
# Attributes
### Characteristic
- textual
	- All commands are plain-text and human-readable
- stateless
	- Neither the server nor the client remember previous communications. For example, relying on HTTP alone, a server can't remember a password you typed or remember your progress on an incomplete transaction. You need an application server for tasks like that.
